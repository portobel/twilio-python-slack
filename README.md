# twilio-python-slack
A Slack bot for receiving and sending SMS messages using Twilio

Based on this project: https://www.twilio.com/blog/build-sms-slack-bridge-python-twilio

You can have an interactive chat (via Slack) with someone who texts a given Twilio number (and theyâ€™ll receive responses via text).
If they (in turn) respond to that response, that response will show up in the thread associated with their number, and the conversation can go on *in the thread* for as long as needed.

This will hold true as long as the conversation is less than *n* days old (where *n* is defined in the environment variable `THREAD_HISTORY_LENGTH_DAYS` below).

All of the below are **required** environment variables. They can be defined in a .env file or as OS environment variables - either will work.

Caveat emptor, there is hardly any error handling or logging in this app at the moment.

```
AUTO_REPLY_MESSAGE=(text for autoreplies, can be left out if no autoreplies are needed)
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=(required text)
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=(required text, like C0123456)
SLACK_CHANNEL_NAME=(required text, like #general)
SLACK_ICON_EMOJI=(required text, like :iphone:)
THREAD_HISTORY_LENGTH_DAYS=2 (some integer value like 2)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=(required text)
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=(required text)
TWILIO_NUMBER=14155551212 (for example, no plus signs or dashes)
TWO_WAY_COMMUNICATION_ENABLED=(not case-sensitive, and any of [true, false, 1, 0, y, n, t, f] will work)
```
